# Alcohol-detector-and-engine-locking-system
The Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System is designed to prevent drunk driving by automatically detecting the driver's alcohol consumption and disabling the vehicle’s ignition if the alcohol level exceeds the legal limit. The system uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to measure the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from the driver's breath. The Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the sensor data and compares it with a predefined BAC threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the system activates an engine lock by controlling a relay, preventing the vehicle from starting or continuing to operate. The system also provides real-time feedback to the driver through an LCD display, LED indicators, and a buzzer, which alerts the driver about the detected alcohol concentration. This intelligent and compact system is suitable for integration into various types of vehicles and can be discreetly installed. The proposed system offers enhanced safety by reducing alcohol related road accidents, making it an essential tool for public safety. The system is also designed to be cost-effective, reliable, and efficient, ensuring practical use in real-world applications. Future enhancements could include integration into vehicle manufacturing, bringing a new level of innovation to automobile safety technology and contributing to the reduction of drunk driving incidents.

Alcohol Detection Techniques: Various studies focus on developing efficient methods for alcohol detection in drivers, with breath alcohol sensors (like MQ-3 and MQ-2) widely used for their sensitivity to alcohol content in the air. In Yadav and Singh’s work (2018), the MQ-3 sensor was implemented to identify breath alcohol levels with an Arduino, emphasizing its affordability and ease of integration in safety applications other approach by Zahran et al. (2019) highlights the integration of alcohol detection systems into vehicles to assess blood alcohol concentration (BAC) accurately. This research demonstrated that breath-based sensors, despite their cost effectiveness, could be improved in accuracy by addressing issues like temperature sensitivity and calibration requirements. king Mechanisms: Studies often pair alcohol detection with automatic engine control, aiming to prevent drunk driving incidents. Kumar et al. (2020) explored a system where, upon detecting a BAC above the legal limit, the microcontroller locks the vehicle’s ignition. This study emphasized the importance of timely response and accurate detection to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation, although it highlighted the need for reliable sensor calibration in real-world settings. Similarly, and Chauhan* (2021) designed a prototype system that used a relay connected to the Arduino to control the ignition circuit. Their findings showed that this simple design could be effective but was prone to false positives in environments with strong odors or other contaminants that might trigger the sensor inadvertently. Microcontroller Embedded Systems: Arduino Uno, equipped with the ATmega328 microcontroller, is frequently selected for these types of safety systems due to its flexibility and user-friendly programming environment. Patil and Nalawade (2019) described a system using Arduino Uno as a core component, noting its ease of integration with sensors and relays for vehicle safety applications. They further demonstrated that Arduino-based systems are feasible for small, standalone applications but may require additional modules for large-scale, commercial use. Challenge Alcohol Detection Accuracy: Research by Vidhya and Raghavendra (2022) indicates that environmental factors like temperature and humidity can affect the accuracy of MQ-series sensors, making recalibration necessary for consistent results. Their study suggests that integrating multiple sensors or using supplementary environmental sensors could improve overall reliability, especially when deployed in different vehicle types or geographical locations. Safety Public Acceptance: A study by Agrawal and Srivastava (2020) highlighted the broader safety implications of implementing alcohol detection systems in vehicles, showing that public acceptance and awareness play a critical role in adoption. They found that while such systems have proven effective in prototypes, widespread implementation requires addressing user concerns about privacy, cost, and reliability.

OBJECTIVE The primary objective of the alcohol detector and engine locking system using Arduino Uno and MQ-3 sensor is to prevent drunk driving by disabling a vehicle’s ignition if the driver’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) exceeds a specified threshold. Here’s a breakdown of the main goals of the system: Enhance Road Safety: The system aims to reduce alcohol-related road accidents by detecting when a driver is intoxicated and preventing vehicle operation, thus minimizing the risk of impaired driving incidents. Real-Time Alcohol Detection: By using the MQ-3 sensor, the system continuously monitors alcohol levels in the driver’s breath and provides immediate feedback, allowing for quick intervention if the BAC is above the legal limit. Automated Engine Control: The system’s integration with the vehicle’s ignition system enables it to automatically lock the engine if alcohol is detected, thereby removing the manual decision-making process and ensuring consistent safety enforcement. Cost-Effective and Compact Solution: Designed with low-cost and readily available components like the Arduino Uno, this system is intended to be affordable and compact, making it suitable for integration into a wide range of vehicle models. Promote Responsible Driving Behaviour: By incorporating a technological deterrent against drunk driving, this system serves as a preventive measure that encourages drivers to avoid alcohol consumption before operating a vehicle. Overall, the system’s objective is to offer an effective, automated solution to curb drunk driving, contributing to safer road environments and aligning with broader public safety and sustainable development goals.
